## üåÄ Introduction

### What is Osu Sync?

Osu Sync is a lightweight yet powerful tool designed to help osu! players seamlessly synchronize their beatmaps, collections, and scores across multiple devices.

Imagine this: you're enjoying a quiet osu! session, and suddenly you need to switch computers, reinstall your system, or‚Äîworst case‚Äîyour PC crashes and needs formatting. You reinstall osu! and then realize... all your beatmaps are gone. Sure, redownloading a few is easy. But if you had hundreds or even thousands, the process becomes tedious, time-consuming, and frustrating.
